               <p> Last updated: January 15, 2023 <br>

               <h2> Refund Policy</h2>
               <p>We are always happy to see our products helping you to accomplish your goals. However if you think you
                  need to get a refund, please, read the section below.</p>
               <hr>
               <br />
               <p>Since we provide non-tangible, irrevocable goods, we do not issue refunds for digital products once
                  the order is confirmed and product is sent. Please note that we offer digital products, not services,
                  so there is no way to close access to the files that you've already received.</p>
               <br />
               <p>The Consumer Rights Act gives you rights to claim against the seller if your digital download is
                  faulty. As a seller, we can issue a refund if there is a technical problem and we can't help you to
                  resolve the matter or if there was a misrepresentation in the product description. In those cases the
                  refund period is 60 days from the moment of the purchase.</p>

               <p>We consider a technical problem to be one of the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Non-delivery of the product: due to some mailing issues of your e-mail provider or your own mail
                     server, you might not receive a delivery email from us. In this case, we recommend contacting us
                     for assistance.</li>
                  <li>Major defects: although all the products are thoroughly tested before release, unexpected errors
                     may occur. Such issues must be reported directly to our technical support.</li>
                  <li>Product not-as-described: such issues must be reported to our technical support within 14 days
                     from the date of the purchase. Clear evidence must be provided proving that the purchased product
                     is not as it is described on the product description page. Complaints which are based merely on the
                     customer's false expectations or wishes are not honored.</li>
               </ul>
               <br />
               <p>In a description available on the preview page of each product we specify the third-party software
                  (plug-ins, add-ons, modules, search engines, scripts, extensions etc) that is compatible with our
                  products. Please kindly note that we do not bear any responsibility and therefore we do not satisfy
                  any refund/return/exchange requests based on incompatibility of our products with some third-party
                  software that is not specified in our products' descriptions.</p>
               <br />
               <P>However, as a customer you are responsible for understanding this upon purchasing any item at our
                  site. There is no obligation to provide a refund or credit in the following situations:</P>
               <ul>
                  <li>You change your mind about an item;</li>
                  <li>You bought an item by mistake;</li>
                  <li>You do not have sufficient expertise to use an item;</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Said Refund Policy is provided through our website in open access. Please note that when purchasing a
                  product through our website you are, as a customer, considered to be aware of our Refund Policy
                  statements.</p>
